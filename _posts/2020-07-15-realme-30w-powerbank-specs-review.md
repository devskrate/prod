4. This has a 15 Layer Charging Protection.
5. This will support USB-C Output, that's pretty much you can ask for.
6. This Power bank doesn't have a micro-USB port, you an charge a device with micro-USB, but you can't charge this with that.

Compared to the last version of this powerbank which comes with 18W Fast Charge support,This is pretty good. The two-way fast charge support willhelp you to charge 2 devices at a time. Thispowerbank doesn't feature micro-USB port, but this makes sense as All Fast charge supported devices are now having a USB-Type C Port.  The low powermode will also help you to charge AIot devices which makes it more interesting. ANd the price of this power bank is also reasonable. Also design looks super-cool execpt that huge brand name on top. Curved design on sides makes us feel like this is thin.
