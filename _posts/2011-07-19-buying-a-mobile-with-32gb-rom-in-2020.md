Generally to run your smartphone smoothly, besides the RAM and the processor you also need a minimum of 1GB to 2GB of free space.

We will divide this article into 3 categories based on 3 types of users.
1. Users who are older people.
2. Normal users & Random gamers
3. Gamers & Vlogers

##### 1. Users who are old:
We generally think for older people 32GB of Internal is enough as they don't use much no.of apps. Just they use whatsapp and other small apps, but this is true few years back and is slightly true for few people now in 2023. Don't get us wrong, let's discuss the truth, Older people started using WhatsApp more than us and they forward mostly every message and share every photo they click.
Coming to thier grand sons and daughters they install every single game in playstore and play them, So basically 64GB storage is just Ok for them, If you get 128GB for few Rupees more, then go for 128GB variant.

##### 2. Normal users & Random gamers:

These people generally are students and job holders.

If we consider students they have many apps, games, movies, photos in their phone. So 64GB is not at all sufficient for them, they definitely need 128GB for sure.
Coming to other type of people, very few can live with 64GB who use their phone very less. So before buying just analyze your usage and base on it go for 64GB/128GB, If you are getting 128GB for few more Rupees, then just go for 128GB variant.

##### 3. Gamers & Vlogers:
These people usually play more no.of heavy games(not limited to 1 or 2) like PUBG, Fortnite etc.. for these people the game takes more space and with these there are also other apps which occupy space, so for these segment of people they definitely need minimum of 128GB variant and can pick 256GB, if they use it for Photography and Videography too..

Verdict: We suggest you to go with 64GB if the phoe is for Older people, If the phone is for normal users and random gamers then go with 128GB, If you are a heavy gamer and if you use your phone for more photography and videography the get minimum of 128GB and get 256GB if you can extend your budget.
