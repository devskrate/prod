Here is an easier and more seamless way to work with GitHub from the command line — [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), currently it is in **beta**. Millions of developers rely on GitHub for software development to make it more fun and collaborative.
The tool `gh` brings the [GitHub](https://github.com/) experience right to your terminal.


#### Installation 
You can install GitHub CLI today on most of the Operating Systems available -
- macOS     
- Windows     
- Linux     

Install this from [here](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation-and-upgrading)

It’s available today for GitHub Team and Enterprise Cloud, but not yet available for GitHub Enterprise Server. This will have support support for Enterprise Server when it’s out of beta.

#### How to use?
`gh` currently suppports with `issues` and `pull requests` because many developers use them every day. Here are few examples provided by GitHub on how `gh` can improve your experience when contributing to an open source project.

- #####  Filter lists to your needs
    Find an open source project you want to contribute to and clone the repository. And then, to see where maintainers want community contributions, use `gh` to **filter the issues** to only show those with `help-wanted` labels.

- #####  Quickly view the details
    Find an **issue** describing a bug that seems like something you can fix, and use `gh` to quickly open it in the browser to get all the details you need to get started.

- #####  Create a pull request
    Create a **branch**, make several commits to fix the bug described in the issue, and use `gh` to create a *pull request* to share your contribution. By using GitHub CLI to create *pull requests*, it also automatically creates a fork when you don’t already have one, and it pushes your branch and creates your *pull request* to get your change merged

- #####  View the status of your work
    Get a quick snapshot the next morning of what happened since you created your *pull request*. `gh` shows the review and check **status** of your *pull requests*

- #####  Easily check out pull requests
    One of the maintainers reviewed your *pull request* and requested changes. You probably switched branches since then, so use `gh` to checkout the *pull request* branch. We never remember the right commands either! Make the changes, push them, and soon enough the pull request is merged—congratulations!
