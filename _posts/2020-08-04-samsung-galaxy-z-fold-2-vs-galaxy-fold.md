Samsung along side the Note 20 also released it's new foldable Galaxy Z Fold 2, let's find out the major improvements when compared to the original fold in the article.

The first major improvement comes by replacing the smaller 4.7-inch display unsalable display is replaced by a bigger  6.2-inch display, which almost covers the entire front of the phone. The main display is also bigger and comes with a 7.6-inch display.

The wired notch present on the top-right in the inner display is replaced by a less obtrusive hole-punch camera that takes up far less space on the folding OLED screen.
